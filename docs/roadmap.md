# Roadmap

Outstanding work for HambotV2 — nothing here is historical. Each task is fully specified in [`software-requirements.md`](software-requirements.md) and designed in [`software-design.md`](software-design.md) before implementation starts. When a task is signed off, remove it here and fold the as-built behavior into those two documents (removing any **(planned)** markers).

Each task carries: **Problem** (what's missing today), **Steps** (ordered checklist, each leaving the build green), and **Acceptance criteria** (what "done" means).

## Phase #2: LLM Integration

- [ ] **LLM integration, phase 1 — automatic presence and bio updates, including the bot's persona (FR-92–FR-95, FR-99, FR-102–FR-104, FR-114 / NFR-21, NFR-25; design §3.12)**

    **Problem**: the bot's presence and bio are static. Use an LLM (a raw Mistral API key) to keep its identity surfaces fresh. Conversation participation and memory are later phases, deliberately out of scope.

    **Steps**:

    1. `Llm/ILlmClient.cs` (chat-completion abstraction) + `Llm/MistralLmClient.cs` (Mistral API; key `Llm:ApiKey`, model `Llm:Model` default `mistral-small-latest`); no key = every LLM feature inactive.
    2. `Llm/PresenceUpdateService.cs` — opt-in hosted loop (`Llm:PresenceUpdates:Enabled`, interval default 60 min): prompt from `Llm:Persona` + bot name/version + date/time + current presence; validate (single line ≤ 128 chars); apply via `IPresenceService`.
    3. Author the default persona seed (FR-99) — the hamster character's voice — as a documented, configuration-overridable default, tuned against real outputs. Part of the feature, not an afterthought.
    4. Failure path (FR-94): error or invalid output → keep current presence/bio, log, retry next tick.
    5. Bio updates (FR-114): `Llm:BioUpdates:Enabled` makes the same tick generate and apply a bio (≤ 190 chars, line breaks allowed) with identical handling and budget accounting.
    6. Guardrails (FR-102–FR-104): per-feature/per-day usage accounting; `Llm:DailyRequestBudget` hard stop (like any other failure: skip, change nothing, log); `!llm status|off|on` kill switch (tier 4, DM-usable; restart restores the configured state). Persona commands (FR-155/FR-156): `!persona` sets/clears the global runtime override (persisted in `BotSetting`), `!settings persona` the per-guild one (persisted in `GuildSetting`) — both tier admin, slash-eligible; resolution chain guild → global → config → shipped seed.
    7. Wire config defaults into `appsettings.json`; secrets per NFR-3; document in design §4.
    8. Unit tests per NFR-21/NFR-25 (fake `ILlmClient`, `FakeTimeProvider`): prompts, both validation boundaries, scheduling, failure path, inactive-without-key, accounting, budget suspension/rollover, kill switch.

    **Acceptance criteria**: the FRs above hold; with a key and the flags on, presence and bio change on schedule in the bot's own voice; without them, nothing changes; the budget is observable via `!llm status` and enforced until UTC rollover; `!llm off` stops all calls until re-enabled or restarted; tests green and warning-free; design §3.12 loses its **(planned)** marker.

- [ ] **LLM conversation participation & memory — future (not yet specified)**

    **Problem**: phase 1 only generates presence text. The end goal is a bot that occasionally participates in conversation with memories and a personality.

    **Plan notes** (pipeline shape designed in §3.20 with FR-157–FR-160 / NFR-33 in §2.25 of the requirements; the phase-B/C *feature* FRs are authored when scheduled. Runs are started by registered `IContextTrigger`s and fed by registered `IContextCollector`s — `ChatContextCollector` for history, a `MemoryCollector` for phase C — on top of the §3.12 foundation toolkit: `LlmGate`/`ILlmUsageTracker` guardrails, `LlmPromptBuilder` with its trust rules; plus the presence service (§3.10) and the MCP endpoint (§3.11)):

    - **Phase B — conversation participation**: per-guild opt-in (a `GuildSetting` flag), bounded cadence (≤ 1 unsolicited reply per N messages / M minutes), reading recent history via the Discord REST API, replying as the bot; failure handling like FR-94.
    - **Phase C — memory & personality**: per-guild tables (conversation summaries, remembered facts), an LLM summarization job, prompts assembled from the persona seed + memories + recent messages; admin commands to inspect/clear a guild's memory.
    - **Trust boundaries (must be part of phase B's spec)**: channel content is **untrusted input** — data, never instructions; it must never trigger commands, tools, database writes, or MCP calls, or change the persona/permissions/config. Phase-B output is restricted to message text (no tool use); secrets are never prompt content; instructions embedded in channel text are ignored. The per-guild opt-in and cadence bounds are the primary containment.
    - **Built-in LLM vs. MCP**: complementary. Built-in features use the raw Mistral key; the operator agent can already drive the bot via MCP (`send_message`, `run_command`). Decide per feature which path fits.

    **Acceptance criteria**: none yet — specifying this task is the first step once scheduled.

## Phase #3: Extra features

- [ ] **Automated hall of fame — reaction tracking and a scheduled digest of a guild's best messages (FRs and design section to be authored when scheduled)**

    **Problem**: a server's best messages — the ones the community reacted to hardest — scroll away and are forgotten; nothing tracks what the community itself upvoted.

    **Steps** (initial plan; full FR set and design authored as the first step once scheduled):

    1. Reaction tracking: request the `MessageReactions` intent explicitly (minimal-intent rule, design §3.1); record reaction adds in a per-guild table (message/channel/author/content snapshot, reacting user, emoji, timestamps). Bots and self-reactions don't score.
    2. Scoring: distinct non-bot, non-author reactions per emoji within a rolling window (`HallOfFame:WindowDays`, default 7); qualify above `HallOfFame:MinScore` (default 3).
    3. Scheduled digest (the `Scheduling/` engine pattern): per opted-in guild on `HallOfFame:DigestCron` (default weekly), post the top `HallOfFame:DigestSize` (default 5) qualifying messages — link plus snapshot, ranked, deduplicated.
    4. Per-guild opt-in and commands: `!hallconfigure` (set/clear channel, show settings) and `!halloffame` (show the current top on demand); server-scoped, help text, in-channel validation.
    5. Config defaults in `appsettings.json`, design §4 documentation, unit tests (mocked client, in-memory database): scoring boundaries, digest selection/dedup, opt-in gating, command behavior.
    6. Decide the interaction with quotes when specifying the FRs (e.g. a one-command promote-to-quote) so the features complement rather than duplicate.

    **Acceptance criteria**: none yet — specifying this task is the first step once scheduled; after that, the criteria mirror the requirement set: opted-in guilds get the digest on schedule with the right messages ranked by community reactions, never repeated, non-opted-in guilds see nothing, build warning-free and tests green.

- [ ] **Absolute-time reminders — `!remindme at <datetime> <message...>` (FRs and design section to be authored when scheduled; extends §2.8/§2.16, design §3.8)**

    **Problem**: `!remindme` only accepts relative durations (FR-62). "Remind me at 18:00" or "at 2026-05-01 09:30" currently has to be computed by hand into `Nh`, which is error-prone around day boundaries, and there is no way to anchor a recurring reminder to a wall-clock time.

    **Steps** (initial plan; full FR set and design authored as the first step once scheduled):

    1. Spec the syntax: a leading `at` token on `!remindme` switches to absolute-time parsing (`remindme at <datetime> <message...>`); decide whether `remindme every at <datetime> <interval> <message...>` anchors a recurrence at a wall-clock time, and keep all times UTC-only (consistent with the quote-of-the-day all-UTC rule, FR-127) — no per-user time zones.
    2. Accepted datetime forms to spec: ISO-like (`yyyy-MM-dd`, `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`, optional seconds, optional `Z`), and the unambiguous `dd.mm.yyyy HH:mm` style; a bare time (`HH:mm`) means the next occurrence of that time UTC. Unparsable or past datetimes are in-channel errors, nothing stored (mirrors FR-63).
    3. Implementation: extend `RemindMeCommand`/`ReminderDurationParser` with the `at` branch (parsed due time instead of duration); the `Reminder` entity, delivery engine (FR-65), caps (FR-70/FR-109), listing, and cancellation stay unchanged — only how `DueAtUtc` is computed differs.
    4. Confirmation reply echoes the absolute due time in UTC (FR-64 shape); slash form (`/remindme`) parses the same free-form arguments (FR-111).
    5. Unit tests per the NFR-16/NFR-24 pattern (`FakeTimeProvider`, InMemory): parsing boundaries (each accepted form, past-time rejection, garbage), next-occurrence rollover for bare times, cap interaction, DM usability (FR-71), recurring anchor if specced.
    6. Document in design §3.8/§4 and the README command table once built.

    **Acceptance criteria**: none yet — specifying this task is the first step once scheduled; after that: `!remindme at <datetime> <message...>` stores and delivers at the exact UTC instant like any other reminder, invalid or past input is an in-channel error with nothing stored, the existing duration and `every` forms are unchanged, build warning-free and tests green.

- [ ] **Further extra features — placeholder (not yet specified)**

    Candidates get their own entry here (Problem / Steps / Acceptance criteria) once proposed and agreed, then are fully specified in the requirements and design docs before implementation.
